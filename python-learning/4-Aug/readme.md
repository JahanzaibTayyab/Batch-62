# Python Basics and Best Practices

## Running a Python Program

- **File Naming:** Python files are saved with a `.py` extension, indicating they contain Python code.
- **Python Interpreter:** The interpreter reads the code, determines the meaning of each word, and executes functions like `print()`.
- **Syntax Highlighting:** Code editors highlight different elements like keywords and strings, helping you identify them easily.

## Using Variables

- **Definition:** Variables are names that refer to values. For example: `message = "Hello Python world!"`.
- **Reassignment:** You can change the value of a variable anytime.

## Naming and Using Variables

- **Rules:**

  - Use letters, numbers, and underscores (`_`); start with a letter or underscore.
  - No spaces; use underscores to separate words.
  - Avoid Python keywords and function names.
  - Variable names are case-sensitive.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the variable's purpose.

## Avoiding Name Errors

- **Common Mistakes:** Misspelling variable names, which causes `NameError`.
- **Tracebacks:** Provide information on where and why an error occurred.

## Variables as Labels

- **Concept:** Variables act as labels attached to values and can be reassigned.

## Strings

- **Definition:** A series of characters enclosed in quotes.
- **Including Quotes:** Use opposite types of quotes for the string and the quote inside it.

## Changing Case in a String

- **Methods:**
  - `.title()`: Capitalizes the first letter of each word.
  - `.upper()`: Converts all characters to uppercase.
  - `.lower()`: Converts all characters to lowercase.

## Using Variables in Strings

- **f-Strings:** Embed expressions inside string literals using `{}`.

## Adding Whitespace to Strings

- **Tabs and Newlines:**
  - `\t` inserts a tab.
  - `\n` inserts a newline.

## Stripping Whitespace

- **Methods:**
  - `.rstrip()`: Removes whitespace from the right side.
  - `.lstrip()`: Removes whitespace from the left side.
  - `.strip()`: Removes whitespace from both sides.

These notes cover fundamental concepts of Python programming, including running programs, using variables, handling strings, and managing errors. Understanding these basics is essential for progressing in Python and programming.
